___

## Executive Summary:


## Business Problem:
For marketing teams, campaign effectiveness directly influences customer acquisition, engagement, and return on ads spend. In this organisation, management ran multiple marketing campaigns across different channels but lacked a clear understanding of which campaigns were driving meaningful results and which were underperforming. The objective was to analyse campaign performance data to evaluate key metrics such as impressions, conversion, and cost efficiency across campaigns.

This analysis aimed to identify high-performing channels, uncover drivers of conversion, and provide actionable insights to optimise future campaigns and improve overall marketing ROAS.
